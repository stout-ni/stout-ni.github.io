This is Stout Ni. At the age of 24, I am currently employed at ByteDance Inc. as a frontend engineer.

My interests are quite diverse, and I have a bit of knowledge in many fields. Among them, my favorites are metal music (More specifically, thrash metal) and enjoying a good drink.I used to be passionate about sports, especially basketball (I'm a dedicated San Antonio Spurs fan of 10 years), but lately, I find myself somewhat limited in keeping up with the physical demands of sports.
